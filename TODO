if 1000 followers - should look like this '1k' (template filter or something)

emails:
when post created
when someone tags you in a comment
send email (contacts)

space details:
reinvent the API (api/space/int:pk>/posts/) - add only one view for posts with many filters (in space details we will filter by space and it will show only the posts in that space)
that way you can make your feed - all posts from last week with highest rating, randomly ordered

list spaces:
filter - most follows. most posts. oldest. newest


user details:
only one page
if you want to see 'user-posts' for example
{% url 'user_details' %}#user-posts

there you can edit your posts or spaces

FIX:
comments has no pagination
